# File Storage

A full stack file storage and sharing application using AWS S3. This application allows you to upload a file of any type (and detects file type to put in appropriate folder). It also has a social networking aspect, allowing you to search for other users by username, send them a friend request, and accept requests. Once a connection is made, you now have access to the other users uploaded files and can pin them to your own profile.
Front end technologies used include ReactJS and React-Bootstrap.
